# Sudoku Solver with Backtracking
___
 
 ### Description
 This script solves Sudoku board either in the terminal or using a visual representation.
 For the two different representations we have 2 scripts associated with them. For the visual representation look at GUI.py, for the terminal representation look at Sudoku.py.

### Installations
Libraries used:
- pygames 
`pip install pygames` for windows

- time
`pip install time` for windows
## Roadmap

As this was an intro project for python, I don't think I'll come back and make the code better as some assets are the same in both GUI.py and Sudoku.py (I could remove the assets that are repeating). I do want to do a project with Optical Character Recognision (OCR) so I may redo this project. The plan is instead of manually putting in a sudoku board, I could use OCR to port an sudoku board automatically but we shall see.
