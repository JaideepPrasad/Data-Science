# Name Match
___
 
### Description
This was a quick projecct for me to understand how cosign similarity works. Cosign similarity is a powerful tool in NLP and even though there are different functions that automate this process for you. However I just wanted to see whats "under the hood" and learn a bit more indepth. There are 2 files with this code that represents the 2 sets of names we compare.

### Installations
Libraries used:
- pandas
- collections
- math

### Summery of Process


### Roadmap
I would like to use this concept in another project and hopfully make a class that can take files in more general formats. As if right now, the format of the file needs to be a name per row in your file.
