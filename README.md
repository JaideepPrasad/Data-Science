# Jaideep Prasad - Data Science Projects Portfolio

Hello! 

My name is Jaideep Prasad but you can call me J. I did my undergraduate at the university of Ottawa where I majored in Electrical Engineering and control systems. In my undergraduate studies I spent a lot of time building different circuits and sytems. While I was able to create a lot of hardware projects, I wanted to bump up my software skills in order to incorperate them in my projects. This is how I found my passion for data science. I started my post graduate studys enrolling in the [Applied A.I. Solutions Development](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-t431) at George Brown early in 2021 in the pursit of becoming a Full Stack Data Scientist. The idea is to be qulified in the Data Analyst, Engineering and Scientist roles while being able to work with/present to technical, business and investors partners.
