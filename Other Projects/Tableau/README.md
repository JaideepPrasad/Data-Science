# NPIs vs Vaccines

This project is a presentation on Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) vs vaccines during Covid 19 that utilizes Tableau. 
### Goal
The goal was to learn how to create a customizable presentation using Tableau. My project was to advise the government on suitable steps to combate the 3rd wave of Covid 19 (currently we started seeing the third wave of Covid 19)

### Process
I had to gather data regarding both vaccine information and NPIs information. I turned the vaccine information into a SQL database so I could learn how to connect differnet file types in Tableau. Both NPIs and vaccine data was preprocessed in Tableau Prep. With the newly aquired data, I preceeded to make graphs that would turn into dashboards and score cards and finally be used in Tableau's story. 
### Files
There are 5 sets of files:
1. group 2 SQL schema.mwb: this is the SQL model created for this project
2. Final_project_group2_.twbx: this is the Tableau file you would open to view the data visulization
3. SQL database script and csv files: this folder contains all the relevent datasets I used for this project
4. Prepped Hyper Files: these are the hyper files from Tableau Prep that contain clean and preprocessed data. The csv files from the folder "SQL database script and csv files" were passed through Tabluea Prep to make sure the data was clean and to also make sure all the file types were compatible with Tableau
5. Data Flow Files: these are the data flow files used to preprocess data related to the specific file name. Here you can see the steps taken to clean the data in Tableau Prep. While this shows you the process used to clean data, the hyper files are the output files of this process.

### Tableau Story

Unfortunately I cannot host the project on Tableau Online indefinitely, so you will not be able to interact with the presentation. Below will be screenshots of the visualization:
