# Covid App High Fidelity Prototype
#
This project is a design/prototyping project revolving around how I would make an app while focusing on UI design and data science. If you have Adobe XD, you can download and open the file directly.

You can access this project using the following link:<br>

When you open the link above, you can interact with the app in 3 ways. 
1. You can click on certain parts of the image (ie. Trends, the location on the top of the screen, the yellow slider)
2. You can use the arrows and home button on the bottom center of the screen
3. You can click on the 2 by 2 square icon on the top left

This project was part of a course I took related to combining data science with design thinking. My goal was to explore datasets revolving Covid 19 and create an app that is user friendly and uses different mechine learing models to display information to users. The main challenge was to convert data (tabular data for the most part) into insight that any user could understand, while having a non black box mechine learning model.

While this project is not done yet, I plan on either turning this into a fully functional app or incorperating many concepts I learned while making this prototype into another project.

Below you can watch a demo of the app:<br>
