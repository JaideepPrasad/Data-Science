# SQL Superstore Database
#
This project is an SQL database using the Superstore dataset. 
### Goal
The goal for this project was to get familier with SQL. The premise of this project was that I was an adviser to a company and my job was to increase profits. To do this I would need to understand business pratices as well as build an SQL database that provided specific data.

### Files
There are 3 sets of files:
1. the csv files used to create the SQL database
2. the SQL files where one of them is a .mwb file that should contain the schema along with everything else in the SQL model (ERD.mwb) and 2 .sql files i used as inqueries to extract what I thought was relevent data.
3. my report on what the company should focus on and how they could potentially increase their profits
